# 📈 Kannu's LeetCode 1000 Grind (Scala Edition)

Welcome to my **personal journey of solving 1000 LeetCode problems** using **Scala**!  
This is my space to track, improve, and challenge myself to become better at problem-solving, algorithms, and functional programming — **one question at a time**.  

---

## 🚀 Goal
> **Solve 1000 LeetCode questions in Scala. No excuses. No shortcuts. Just grind.**

- ✅ **Track progress** publicly to stay accountable.  
- ✅ Focus on **writing clean, idiomatic Scala code**.  
- ✅ Cover a variety of topics: **Algorithms, Data Structures, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and more**.  
- ✅ Reflect on mistakes and learn from them (failure is part of the process).  

---

## 💡 Why?
Because **consistency beats motivation** — and solving 1000 problems will build **real, unshakable skills**.  
Also, Scala is awesome and underrepresented in competitive programming — let's change that!  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Scala 3 / Scala 2.13  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Testing:** Simple custom test cases for now (may add proper testing later).
